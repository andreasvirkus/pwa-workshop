# PWA, SW & WTH?

A workshop to introduce my co-workers to Progressive Web Applications &
ServiceWorkers.

Slides can be found in `/index.html` and they're built with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

Various (really?) examples can be found in `/examples` (and hopefully will be updated in the future with more
complex additions).

Feel free to use and/or modify this to your liking.

## TODO:
