          <h2>The <code>What the Hack</code> part</h2>
          <blockquote>Progressive Web Apps use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like user
            experience. They evolve from pages in browser tabs to immersive, top-level apps,
            maintaining the web's low friction at every moment.</blockquote>
            <p>- Google Developers</p>

					<blockquote>Service worker (SW) is a programmable network proxy, allowing you to control
            how network requests from your page are handled.</blockquote>

          <h2>PWA</h2>

          It "is"/"should have"...
          <ul class="font-smallest">
            <li><strong>Progressive</strong> - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because<br> it's built with <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> as a core tenet.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive</strong> - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity independent</strong> - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.</li>
            <li><strong>App-like</strong> - Feels like an app, because the app shell model separates the application<br><em>functionality</em> from application <em>content</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh</strong> - Always up-to-date thanks to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers">service worker</a> update process.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe</strong> - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.</li>
            <li><strong>Discoverable</strong> - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to  <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2014/11/Support-for-installable-web-apps-with-webapp-manifest-in-chrome-38-for-Android">W3C manifest</a><br> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/service-worker/registration">service worker registration</a> scope, allowing search engines to find it.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-engageable</strong> - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Installable</strong> - Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen<br> without the hassle of an app store.</li>
            <li><strong>Linkable</strong> - Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.</li>

            <h2>Service Workers</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>A <code>Web Worker</code> at its core, meaning it can't access the DOM</p>
              <p>Service worker is a programmable network proxy, allowing you to control how network requests from your page are handled.</p>
              <p>It's terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on
                global state within a service worker's onfetch and onmessage handlers. If there is
                information that you need to persist and reuse across restarts, service workers do have access to the IndexedDB API.</p>

            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>A stateless, event-driven API</p>

            <img alt="A list of ServiceWorker events" src="/code-examples/sw-events.png">

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Install is great for priming your cache (defining which resources to cache by default).</p>
              <p>Activate can be used to remove stale cache.</p>
              <p>Registration also exposes the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope (useful later in push notifications)</p>
              <p>All ServiceWorker events may be terminated if they're taking an unreasonable amount of time or CPU.

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The caches built-in is a promise-based API that helps you cache responses,
                as well as finding and deleting them.</p>
              <p>You can open a cache by name, and this method returns a promise. We use
                a versioned cache name here so that we can remove old cache entries in
                one fell swoop later, when phasing out an older service worker.</p>
              <p>After the cache is opened, we can fill it with the offline fundamentals.

            <h2>Background Sync</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>In keeping with the <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">Extensible Web</a>, this is a low level feature that gives you
                a lot of freedom. You ask for an event to be fired when the user has connectivity (which is immediate if the user
                already is online).</p>
              <p>Like push messaging, it uses a service worker as the event target, which enables it to work even when the page isn’t open.</p>
              <p>A great use case as you can imagine, is allowing you to retry a failed request when the connection is more stable.</p>
            </aside>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Events</h2>

            <img alt="A list of BackgroundSync events" src="/code-examples/sync-events.png">

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>You start out by registering for the worker's sync event with an action-specific (unique!) tag.</p>
              <p>Then, you listen for that event (SW-side) and do whatever you need to do.</p>
            </aside>

            <h2>Gotchas</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Unique sync tag name</li>
              <li>The async function inside waitUntil has to throw or reject</li>
            </ul>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>People get around the unique tag situation by following progressive-networking principlas</p>
              <p>Meaning you always cache first locally, then pass the sync handler and in the sync handler
                always visit the local storage first.</p>
              <p>The sync event will only be added to the queue if it fails (throws/rejects). Silent-fails are not ok</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Periodic sync</h2>

            <p>Currently the spec is in design and opening a site to find content you hadn't
              seen before - without going to the network - is a user experience currently limited
              to native apps.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This will allow you to request a “periodicsync” event that will be restricted by time, battery state and network state.</p>
              <p>The API is still in design, but it might look a little something like the code below:</p>

            <h2>Push notifications</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>A notification is a message that pops up on the user's device. Notifications can be triggered
                locally by an open application, or they can be "pushed" from the server to the user even when
                the app is not running. They allow your users to opt-in to timely updates and allow you to
                effectively re-engage users with customized content.</p>
              <p>App-side they can be generated either client-side or in the worker thread (slight difference)</p>
              <p>Two APIs: Notifications API (app-code) and Push API (server code)</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>You can check to see if you already have permission by checking the value of the
                Notification.permission read only property. It can have one of three possible values:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>default</li>
                <li>granted</li>

            <h2><code>Notification()</code></h2>

            <img alt="Very basic push notifications usage example" src="/code-examples/push-usage.png">

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Next, a new notification is created using the Notification() constructor. This must be passed a title argument,
                and can optionally be passed an options object to specify options, such as text direction, body text, icon to display,
                notification sound to play, and more.</p>
              <p>irefox and Safari close notifications automatically after a few moments (around four seconds).
                This may also happen at the operating system level. Some browsers don't however, such as Chrome.
                To make sure that the notifications close in all browsers, at the end of the above functions,
                we call the Notification.close function inside a setTimeout() function to close the notification
                after 4 seconds. Also note the use of bind() to make sure the close() call is associated with the notification.</p>

              <p>These are options the user can choose among in order to act on the action within the context of
                the notification itself. The action's name is sent to the service worker notification handler
                to let it know the action was selected by the user.</p>

              <p>
                The following options are listed in the most up-to-date spec, but are not supported in any browsers yet.

                silent: A Boolean specifying whether the notification should be silent, i.e. no sounds or vibrations should be issued,
                regardless of the device settings. The default is false, which means it won't be silent.
                sound: A USVString containing the URL of an audio file to be played when the notification fires.
                noscreen: A Boolean specifying whether the notification firing should enable the device's screen or not.
                The default is false, which means it will enable the screen.
                sticky: A Boolean specifying whether the notification should be 'sticky', i.e. not easily clearable by the user.
                The default is false, which means it won't be sticky.</p>

              <p>A list of notification events and SW notification properties</p>
              <p>The notifications API spec lists two events that are triggered on the Notification instance: click & error</p>
              <p>These events can be tracked using the <code>onclick</code> and <code>onerror</code> handlers. Because Notification also inherits from
                EventTarget, it's possible to use the <code>addEventListener()</code> method on it.</p>
              <p>Note: Trying to create a notification inside the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope using the Notification() constructor will throw an error.</p>
              <p>That's why you need to use the ServiceWorker scope <code>.showNotification()</code> method</p>
